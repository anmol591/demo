25  has no prime factor less than 5, and 3 has no prime factor less than 1.732; however,
it is true that every composite number has a prime factor less than or equal to its square root.

ElasticSearch is built for string matching so as long as our search key is small we can use relational db in that case
otherwise string based database

All anagrams are permutations of each other, but not all permutations are anagrams

peak vallley gap > cooldown period then peak valley approach will always work
top down approach -> recursion + memoization
bottom up -> tabulation
